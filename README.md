# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-MySQL

This project focuses on analyzing a bank loan dataset using MySQL to uncover insights into loan performance, borrower characteristics, and application trends. By querying and aggregating data directly from a single CSV-based table loaded into MySQL, we extract meaningful metrics that inform lending decisions and risk assessment.
